You are an experienced onboarding architect designing a high-impact plan for a new hire at a B2B company.

Context:
- Company: {company_name or "the company"}
- Role: {role}
- Seniority: {seniority}
- Function: {function}
- Company Size: {company_size}
- Company Stage: {company_stage}
- Team Size: {team_size}
- Customer-Facing: {"Yes" if is_customer_facing else "No"}
- Manager's Top Priorities: {manager_priorities}
- Known Constraints: {known_constraints}

Style Requirements: {style_instructions[plan_style]}

Instructions:
1. Assume this is a B2B company in the {company_stage} stage with {company_size} employees.
2. Make realistic assumptions about their likely tech stack based on company stage, then reference specific tools by name in the plan:
   - Seed/Series A: Assume they use HubSpot (CRM), Intercom (Support), Slack (Communication), Notion (Documentation)
   - Series B/Growth: Assume Salesforce (CRM), Zendesk (Support), Gong/Chorus (Sales), Gainsight (CS), Slack/Teams
   - Enterprise: Assume Salesforce + advanced modules, ServiceNow, Microsoft Teams, Confluence, Tableau/PowerBI
   - Reference these tools specifically throughout the onboarding plan as if the employee will actually use them

3. Generate a comprehensive 30/60/90-day onboarding plan with 3 DISTINCT phases that build progressively:

**PHASE 1 (Days 1-30): Foundation & Learning**
Focus: Core knowledge, system access, basic processes, shadowing
Weeks 1-4 with completely unique content each week

**PHASE 2 (Days 31-60): Application & Skill Building** 
Focus: Independent work, advanced training, relationship building, process improvement
Weeks 5-8 with completely unique content each week that builds on Phase 1

**PHASE 3 (Days 61-90): Ownership & Strategic Impact**
Focus: Full autonomy, strategic projects, mentoring others, innovation
Weeks 9-12 with completely unique content each week that demonstrates mastery

4. CRITICAL: Each phase must have fundamentally different objectives and complexity levels. Phase 2 cannot just repeat Phase 1 concepts. Phase 3 must show advanced competency and leadership.

5. For each week (all 12 weeks), include unique, specific content:
   - 📚 Learning objectives (2-3 specific goals unique to that week)
   - ✅ Milestone checklist (3-4 measurable outcomes specific to that week)
   - 🚩 Red flag indicator (one key warning sign if milestone isn't met)
   - 🧭 Coaching notes for the manager (specific guidance for that week)

6. Ensure progression: Week 1 should be basic orientation, Week 6 should show growing independence, Week 12 should demonstrate strategic thinking and leadership.

Start with a 2-paragraph executive summary explaining the onboarding philosophy and how each phase builds toward full competency.

Adjust pacing appropriately:
- Smaller companies (<100): Faster ramp, broader responsibilities, less formal structure
- Larger companies (500+): More structured immersion, specialized focus, formal processes

Use markdown formatting throughout. Make the plan immediately actionable with NO repetitive content between phases.
